# Cristina-Ruby-Lee

This is my personal website and portfolio, built to showcase my projects and experience. The site was created using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with minimal dependencies to keep it lightweight and easy to maintain.

## Features
- Custom responsive design without frontend frameworks
- Project carousel implemented using the Flickity library
- Contact form powered by Flask with Google reCAPTCHA for spam protection
- Currently hosted using Render (Hosting provider may change in the future due to reliability concerns on the free tier!)

## Technologies Used
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, Javascript
- Backend: Flask (Python)
- Security: Google reCAPTCHA, enviornment variable configuration
- Deployment: Render

## File Structure
```
/static/         - CSS, JavaScript, and image files  
/templates/      - HTML templates  
/app.py          - Flask app with route handling for the contact form
